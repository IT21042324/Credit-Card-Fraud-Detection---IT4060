## Getting Started

Before you can run the project, there are some prerequisites that need to be installed.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the following dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib tensorflow Imblearn scipy.stats datetime category_encoders sklearn joblib
```

OR
```bash
# create a venv
python -m venv env

# activate venv
env\scripts\activate

# install notebook
pip install notebook

# install the requirements.txt file
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
